//! Answers stored in a written STEP and resumed from it (port of `resume.py`).
//!
//! Writing a part, specify-core also stores the answers it was given in the file, so that
//! opening the file again resumes them: the analysis is of the geometry alone and carries the
//! answers back, and writing it again replaces its PMI rather than adding to it. The payload is
//! Python's: `{schema, answers, part, face_count, faces}` as compact JSON, base64-encoded (a
//! Part 21 string then needs no escapes), `faces` being a [`fingerprint`] of the part's faces
//! that is checked before unnamed face indices are trusted. Named parts write schema 3 with
//! authored STEP names; wholly unnamed parts keep schema 2 and its bytes. Schemas 1/2 still read.
//!
//! **Where it is stored.** Python appends its own text: `PROPERTY_DEFINITION('pmi-assist
//! answers','schema 1',#pd)` with a representation holding one
//! `DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('pmi-assist answers','<base64>')`. This port writes the
//! same item through haecceity, as a CAx-IF user defined attribute on the part
//! ([`attribute_set`]: `AttributeSet` 'pmi-assist answers' with that one string item), within
//! the same `pmi::write` edit as the PMI: a standard construct that haecceity's reader consumes
//! as the part's, so a replace removes it with the PMI it describes. Both forms carry the same
//! `DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('pmi-assist answers','<base64>')`, which is all Python's
//! reader looks for, so each engine resumes the other's files; [`stored`] reads both.
//!
//! In an assembly each part's answers are stored on that part and say which part they are for;
//! a part with none stored has not been written by specify-core.
