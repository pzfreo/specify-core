//! The steps: parts, analyse, mesh, questions, apply, preview, write (port of `api.py`).
//!
//! A file of several parts is specified a part at a time: [`parts`] lists them, [`analyse`] and
//! [`mesh`] take the one to work on, and [`write_parts`] writes any number of them into the
//! assembly together. The command line (`main.rs`) and `serve` are thin layers over these.
//!
//! Each step that reads a file has two forms, as Python's take a path or a `LoadedPart`: one on
//! a part already loaded ([`analyse`], [`mesh`], [`write`]) and one on a path
//! ([`analyse_file`], [`mesh_file`], [`write_file`]), which loads the part first.
//!
//! **In memory** (for a caller with no filesystem, the editor's browser build): a file's bytes
//! are read with [`part::File::of_bytes`] (any part, [`part::File::load`]) or
//! [`part::load_bytes`] (a file of one part); [`analyse`] and [`mesh`] take the part so loaded,
//! and [`write_bytes`] writes any of the file's parts and returns the bytes written with the
//! report. Nothing in these reads a path.
//!
//! The analysis, answers and intent are JSON values, as in Python: an analysis is a stored
//! snapshot that may come from either engine or an older version, and the rules read it as
//! such.

// JSON index writes below target objects produced by PartSummary serialization or to_presented_dict().
