//! Where a hole is: its distance from reference planes, as AP242 location dimensions (port of
//! the semantic part of `locations.py`).
//!
//! A hole positioned by a tolerance has **basic** dimensions (exact, boxed on a drawing) from
//! the planes of its datum frame; a hole located by ± dimensions has toleranced ones from the
//! part's edge faces. Either way a dimension runs from a plane along the hole's axis (whose
//! normal is square to it) to the axis, for each hole of a pattern. A frame of axes (a bolt
//! circle round a bore) has no plane to measure from: its holes get none here.
//!
//! Python's `mark_basic` is not ported: it edits the written file because OpenCascade cannot
//! mark a dimension basic, and haecceity writes a basic dimension as such.
