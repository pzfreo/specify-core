//! One STEP file loaded once, its parts told apart and its faces numbered (port of `load.py`).
//!
//! Everything downstream (recognition, existing PMI, intent, the writer and the browser's
//! picking) refers to faces by their position in one part's face list. A part is numbered on its
//! own shape, not on a placed instance, in specify-core's order (OpenCascade's
//! `TopExp::MapShapes`), which haecceity's [`PartDefinition`] reproduces: face `i` is the face
//! read from `definition.faces[i]`. Both engines therefore number the same file's faces alike
//! and the binding keeps [`LOADER_VERSION`] 2 (docs/design.md, "Face numbering is the same in
//! both engines"; question Q1).
//!
//! A file is read once, by haecceity's [`StepFile::read`] ([`File`]): its distinct parts, their
//! names and product ids, and each part's own `Part` on demand ([`StepFile::part`]), in its own
//! coordinates with its faces in the definition's order, its face and edge sources and its
//! unresolved faces and edges as haecceity records them. A part of an assembly, or a part placed
//! away from the origin, is therefore haecceity's own `Part` like any other (upstream needs U1
//! and U9, met; the stand-ins that read the file placed back and rebuilt the part are gone).
//!
//! What differs from Python: a gzipped file is refused like any unreadable one (specify-core
//! never reads gzip); a file's parts are haecceity's product definitions, so a product whose
//! shape is a solid plus surface models (NIST CTC-02, 04, 05) is one part here where
//! OpenCascade's XCAF splits it into a part per shape (see `parts`, question Q7); a file with
//! several root shapes, which Python refuses ("expected one part"), is read; part names follow
//! Python's rule over `NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE`s (haecceity's `PartDefinition.name`), not
//! over XCAF's labels.
