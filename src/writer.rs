//! Intent written into the STEP as AP242 semantic PMI through haecceity, and verified by reading
//! back (port of `writer.py`, and of what `requirements.py` and `merge.py` achieve).
//!
//! Each part's intent becomes one [`PartPmi`] (`part_pmi`): datums A–H on their datum
//! features (coplanar faces, or a hole's cylinders for an axis datum), sizes (an ISO 286 fit as
//! the fit, `±` and limits as deviations), locations (basic, or deviations) from the reference
//! faces to the feature, geometric tolerances with their zone, modifier and datum system,
//! material, the general tolerance as a class, threads (with their manufacturing data as a
//! user defined attribute set, upstream need U8), knurls, surface finish and the part's notes.
//! Every part is written in one `haecceity::pmi::write` edit of the file, which validates every
//! instance it makes against the AP242 schema before anything is returned.
//!
//! **Modes.** A part with no PMI, or one specify-core wrote (answers stored that match its
//! faces, [`resume`]), is written by `Mode::Replace`: afterwards its PMI is exactly the
//! intent's. A part with PMI from elsewhere is written by `Mode::Add`: every original byte is
//! kept, the new items are written beside the file's own, a datum letter the file has is the
//! file's datum, and no answers are stored (its PMI could not be told apart from what was
//! added, as in Python). In an assembly each part written has its own mode by the same rule: a
//! part that resumes its answers is replaced while another with PMI from elsewhere is added to
//! in the same write (two haecceity edits, replace then add; one when the modes agree). An assembly
//! follows Python's rule that each part is written with its answers, but not its rule that every
//! part with answers stored is written again: one part may be written alone, and haecceity's
//! per-part replace leaves the other parts, their PMI and their stored answers byte for byte as
//! they were (decision D3, 2026-10-15; Python refused, as OpenCascade rewrote the whole file).
//! An assembly with PMI from elsewhere, which Python refuses because of OpenCascade, is written
//! by `Mode::Add` (question Q6, a deliberate difference).
//!
//! **Notes and finish** (question Q3, decided 2026-10-09). A surface finish (`Ra 3.2`, on faces
//! or the part's default) is a surface texture in ISO 10303-1110's form, 'any process allowed'
//! (ISO 1302's basic symbol, which an unqualified `Ra 3.2` means); the part's other notes
//! (coating, heat treatment, edges) are the PMI practice's 'semantic text' on the part (§7.4),
//! each named by its kind in Python's text route ('surface treatment', 'heat treatment', 'edge
//! condition'), which specify-core reads. Free-text part notes use `general note` plus a
//! one-based integer `note index` in each set (see `docs/part-notes.md`).
//!
//! **Knurls** are written as AP242's `turned_knurl`, the parameters it needs beyond the intent's
//! diameter and pitch derived from the knurling standard where the intent does not state them,
//! and the warnings say so (questions Q4, Q15; `knurl`).
//!
//! **What is not written** is listed in the report's `not_written`, each saying why, never
//! dropped silently: a finish that is not `Ra <micrometres>`, and a knurl whose pattern or pitch
//! the standard does not give. So is a requirement that names no faces (`the size on
//! holes:16`), having nothing in the file to be written on; the rest of the intent is written
//! (question Q17).
//!
//! **What is not ported**, because it only works round OpenCascade: the text fixes
//! (`_drop_runout_zones`, `_type_limits`, `_simple_tolerances`, `_part_datums`), the metre
//! scale for tolerances, fits written as bare limits, one datum label per tolerance, the text
//! route for threads, knurls, notes and the general tolerance, the leaders, and `merge.py`'s
//! transplant (haecceity's add mode keeps the original bytes itself).
//!
//! **Atomic output.** The result is written beside the destination (`.name.pid.rand.part`),
//! read back from there and verified (`verify`, the stand-in for upstream need U7), and only
//! then renamed over the destination: a symbolic link is written through to its target, an
//! existing file keeps its permissions, and any failure leaves the destination and the source
//! as they were.
//!
//! **In memory.** [`write_bytes`] (one part of a file of one part) and [`write_parts_bytes`]
//! (any parts of one file, an assembly's included) are the same write for a caller with no
//! filesystem (the editor's browser build): the bytes are returned rather than staged, after the
//! same verification of what was written. The file's other parts, where the writer consults
//! them, are loaded from the parts' bytes, never from a path. An unchanged resumed write
//! retains the original bytes when its complete planned PMI and stored answers match them;
//! the replacement candidate is still written and verified before that no-op is accepted.
//!
//! **Caller attributes.** [`write_bytes_with`] and [`write_parts_bytes_with`] accept extra
//! [`AttributeSet`]s, written as given and verified in the same edit as the PMI and stored
//! answers. [`write_with`] and [`write_parts_with`] do the same for a destination, including
//! `.gz`. Nonempty extras require a file of one part. The stored-answers name ([`resume::NAME`])
//! is reserved for both set and item names, since resume reads items by name. Extras follow
//! the usual write mode: on a resumed part replace removes the previous attributes along with
//! the previous PMI and answers, so supply every extra wanted in the new write; add leaves
//! existing attributes alone. There is no separate merge or update by attribute name.
