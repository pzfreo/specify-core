# Specify

**Add manufacturing intent to a STEP part, write it as AP242 semantic PMI, and keep it with the
part as the model changes.**

Specify reads a STEP part and recognises its features: holes, threads, hole patterns, slots,
bosses and turned diameters. It then asks what a drawing would need to say, and proposes an
answer, with its reason, for each question:

- the material;
- what each hole is for;
- which faces are datums;
- fits, threads, positions;
- surface finish and the general tolerance.

It writes your answers into the STEP file as AP242 semantic PMI, which CAD and inspection tools
can read, and verifies the file by reading it back. The answers are stored in the file too. When
the part changes, Specify carries them to the new revision and says what changed. An answer it
can't place is listed, never silently moved.

It is deterministic (rules and standards tables, no AI) and pure Rust: no OpenCascade, no
Python. Feature recognition and the STEP/AP242 kernel come from
[quiddity-rust](https://github.com/pzfreo/quiddity-rust).

## Ways to use it

One engine, one set of answers and files, whichever way you call it:

| Use | Install | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Command line** | a [release](https://github.com/pzfreo/specify-core/releases) binary, or `cargo build --release` | [below](#command-line) |
| **Python** | `pip install specify-core` (CPython 3.12+, no dependencies) | [below](#python), [package README](crates/specify-core-py/README.md) |
| **Rust** | `specify-core = { git = "https://github.com/pzfreo/specify-core", tag = "v0.1.5" }` | [below](#rust), [docs/library.md](docs/library.md) |
| **Browser** (WebAssembly) | `specify-core-wasm-<version>.tgz` on each release | [docs/wasm.md](docs/wasm.md) |
| **Host process** (JSON lines) | `specify-core serve` | [below](#host-process) |
| **GitHub pull requests** | `uses: pzfreo/specify-core/step-diff@main` | [step-diff/README.md](step-diff/README.md) |

The Specify editor at [draftwright.io](https://editor.draftwright.io/specify) runs the
WebAssembly build in the browser.

## Specify a part

The flow is the same everywhere:

1. **Analyse** the part.
2. **Answer** the questions. Each answer is a question id and a value, for example
   `{"part.material": "6082-T6", "hole.function:holes:9": "fit:H7"}`. Accept the proposed
   defaults for the rest, or answer every one.
3. **Write** a verified STEP file.

### Command line

```bash
specify-core analyse plate.step -o plate.analysis.json          # features, faces, existing PMI
specify-core questions plate.analysis.json --open                # what is still unanswered
echo '{"part.material": "6082-T6", "hole.function:holes:9": "fit:H7"}' > answers.json
specify-core write plate.step plate.analysis.json answers.json -o plate-pmi.step --accept-defaults
```

`write` refuses until every question has an answer, or `--accept-defaults` supplies the rest.
It prints a JSON report with `output`, `written`, `not_written` and `warnings`.

Exit codes:
- **0:** done.
- **1:** a write that didn't verify, or a file that can't be read.
- **2:** a refusal, such as an unanswered question, an invalid answer or bad arguments.

`specify-core mesh plate.step -o plate.mesh.json` writes the part's triangles grouped by face,
for a face picker.

### Python

```python
from specify_core import api

analysis = api.analyse("plate.step")

for q in api.questions(analysis, {}):                 # what is still unknown
    print(q.id, "|", q.prompt, "| default:", q.default)

answers = {"part.material": "6082-T6", "hole.function:holes:9": "fit:H7"}
intent = api.apply(analysis, answers, accept_defaults=True)
report = api.write("plate.step", intent, "plate-pmi.step", answers=answers)

print(report.written)       # ['datum A', 'Ø8 H7 on holes:9', 'position 0.05 on holes:9', ...]
print(report.not_written)   # anything not written, with the reason
```

The other functions are listed in the [package README](crates/specify-core-py/README.md):
- `parts` and `load`, for assemblies and reading a file once;
- `preview`;
- `write_parts`;
- `mesh`;
- `diff`;
- `pmi_scene`.

### Rust

```rust
use std::path::Path;

use serde_json::{Map, Value, json};
use specify_core::{api, part, writer};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let loaded = part::load(Path::new("plate.step"), None)?;
    let analysis = api::analyse(&loaded)?;

    let answers: Map<String, Value> = serde_json::from_value(json!({
        "part.material": "6082-T6",
        "hole.function:holes:9": "fit:H7",
    }))?;
    for q in api::questions(&analysis, &answers)? {
        println!("{}", q.id);
    }

    let intent = api::apply(&analysis, &answers, true)?;
    let report = writer::write(&loaded, &intent, Path::new("plate-pmi.step"), Some(&answers))?;
    println!("{:?}", report.written);
    Ok(())
}
```

`writer::write_bytes` returns the verified STEP in memory instead. In-memory loading, extras
and characteristic numbers are covered in [docs/library.md](docs/library.md).

### Opening the file again

The answers are stored in the written file, so analysing it again resumes them. In Python,
`api.analyse("plate-pmi.step")["resume"]["answers"]` returns them. Parts made by code-first CAD
tools that name their faces (cadgen today) keep their answers on the same faces across rebuilds;
see [docs/face-names.md](docs/face-names.md).

### Assemblies

An assembly is specified a part at a time. `parts` lists its distinct parts; a part placed
twice is one part with two placements. `analyse` and `mesh` take a part index. `write` takes an
analysis and answers for each part and writes them all at once, each part's PMI on its own
product definition:

```bash
specify-core parts asm.step
specify-core analyse asm.step --part 0 -o plate.json
specify-core analyse asm.step --part 1 -o pin.json
specify-core write asm.step plate.json plate-a.json pin.json pin-a.json -o out.step --accept-defaults
```

Writing a part again replaces its PMI and answers. A part written alone leaves the other parts
as they were.

## Review a revision

Given two versions of a part, Specify says what changed in words a person can check against
the model, draws the change, and carries the answers to the new revision.

```bash
specify-core diff old.step new.step --answers old.answers.json -o changes
```

`changes/` gets:
- `report.md`: the review, written to post as a pull request comment;
- `model.png`: the new part, with changed faces orange, new faces green, and gone or moved faces
  in translucent red;
- `answers.json`: the carried answers, to commit;
- `report.json`: all of the above as data.

PMI changes are listed by characteristic number (for example `#7 ⌀6.6 H7 → ⌀6.6 H8`). Without
`--answers`, the answers stored in the old file are carried.

In Python, `api.diff("old.step", "new.step")` returns the same `{report, markdown}`.
[docs/diff.md](docs/diff.md) explains how the two parts are matched and what carries.

To post the review on every pull request that changes a STEP file, add the
[STEP diff action](step-diff/README.md):

```yaml
      - uses: pzfreo/specify-core/step-diff@main
```

[pzfreo/step-diff-demo](https://github.com/pzfreo/step-diff-demo) is a working example.

## Install the command line

Each [release](https://github.com/pzfreo/specify-core/releases) has the command line for Linux
(x86_64), macOS (Apple silicon) and Windows (x86_64), each with a SHA-256 checksum:

```bash
v=v0.1.5; t=aarch64-apple-darwin   # or x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
gh release download $v -R pzfreo/specify-core -p "specify-core-$v-$t.tar.gz*"
shasum -a 256 -c specify-core-$v-$t.tar.gz.sha256 && tar -xzf specify-core-$v-$t.tar.gz
./specify-core-$v-$t/specify-core --help
```

On Windows, the `.zip` holds `specify-core.exe`. To build from source with the toolchain in
`rust-toolchain.toml`, run `cargo build --release`, which produces `target/release/specify-core`.

## Host process

`specify-core serve` answers JSON requests, one per line on stdin, with one reply per line on
stdout. Each request carries everything it needs, so a restarted process loses nothing.

```bash
echo '{"id": 1, "op": "analyse", "step": "part.step"}' | specify-core serve
```

- **Ops:** `parts`, `analyse`, `questions`, `preview`, `interpret` and `write`.
- **Replies:** each reply is `{"id", "ok": true, "result"}` or `{"id", "ok": false, "error": {"code", "message"}}`.
- **Protocol:** defined in `src/serve.rs`.

## What it writes

AP242 semantic PMI:
- datums and datum systems;
- size dimensions with ± and fit tolerances, and location dimensions;
- position, flatness, perpendicularity, parallelism, profile and runout tolerances;
- threads and knurls;
- surface texture;
- material;
- notes and the general tolerance;
- characteristic numbers for inspection.

Every file is read back and checked before it is kept.

## Status

**0.1.5** (2026-10-31). Until 1.0:
- a minor release (0.2, 0.3) may change the command line, the JSON formats or answer ids, and its
  [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) entry says how to upgrade;
- a patch release doesn't.

The design and how each part is verified are in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

Specify began as a port of the Python implementation, now archived as
[specify-core-python](https://github.com/pzfreo/specify-core-python). It still reads the files
that implementation wrote. The `specify-core` Python package is now this engine; see
[docs/python.md](docs/python.md).

## Tests

```bash
cargo test --release
SPECIFY_CORPUS=/path/to/quiddity-corpus/tests/corpus cargo test --workspace --release   # with the corpus
```

CI runs the whole workspace against the pinned [quiddity-corpus](https://github.com/pzfreo/quiddity-corpus)
with `QUIDDITY_CORPUS_REQUIRED=1`, which fails when the corpus or a captured input is missing.
Set it locally to require the same.
