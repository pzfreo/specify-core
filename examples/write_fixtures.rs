//! Writes the Rust-written STEP files of the cross-engine check (`tests/cross_engine.rs`).
//!
//! For each synthetic and NIST case of the Python oracle (`tests/fixtures/oracle/{parts,nist}`)
//! whose every part has Python's accept-defaults intent (`apply.json.gz`), the Rust writer
//! (`writer::write_parts`, library calls only) writes those intents into the case's input, every
//! part in one write as Python's case-level write does, with the oracle's base answers stored
//! (`meta.answers`). The result goes to `tests/fixtures/cross_engine/<case>/rust.step.gz`; a
//! write the Rust writer refuses goes to `rust.refused.txt` instead, its message, so a refusal
//! is a recorded result too, not a silently missing case.
//!
//! Python's read-back of each file is then captured with specify-core's own environment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release --example write_fixtures
//! /Users/paul/repos/specify-core/.venv/bin/python tools/capture.py cross-engine tests/fixtures/cross_engine
//! ```
//!
//! **For quiddity-rust#137.** Recaptured with v0.2.6: default presentation adds callouts,
//! surface symbols and notes; composite and location aspects change semantic structure.
//! These files include #65 ids/history and are checked byte for byte, with independent
//! Python readbacks. Historical category-order and alpha.7 specimens remain unchanged.
//!
//! **Regenerating.** `tests/cross_engine.rs` checks that each committed file is still exactly
//! what the writer produces today (the decompressed bytes, byte for byte; the writer is
//! deterministic and a write's bytes depend only on the input and the intent). When a
//! deliberate change to the writer or to haecceity changes them, the test fails naming the
//! case: rerun this example, recapture Python's read-back (above) and review the
//! `known_differences/cross_engine.json` entries the new read-back meets, in one commit.
//!
//! The gzip wrapper is not part of the check (a different `flate2` may compress differently);
//! it is written with no file name and a zero time stamp, so rerunning on the same build gives
//! the same `.gz` bytes too.

// When `tests/cross_engine.rs` includes this file as a module, it uses the case list and the
// write but not `main`.
#![allow(dead_code)]

// Public so that `tests/cross_engine.rs`, which includes this file, uses this one copy.
