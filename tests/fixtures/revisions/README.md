# Revision pairs

Pairs of revisions of one small part (`<case>.old.step.gz`, `<case>.new.step.gz`) for
`tests/revision.rs`. They are quiddity-rust's correspondence fixtures
(`tests/fixtures/revisions`), copied unchanged:

| Case | What changed |
| --- | --- |
| `hole_moved` | the Ø6 hole moved from x = 40 to x = 25 |
| `hole_added` | a Ø7 hole added at (30, 30) |
| `hole_removed` | the Ø7 hole at (30, 30) removed; the holes after it renumber |
| `boss_resized` | the boss Ø20 → Ø26 |
| `plate_thickened` | the plate 10 → 12 thick; its pattern holes are symmetric repeats |
| `whole_part_moved` | the whole part turned and moved, nothing else |

The `complex_*` pairs are made by `complex.py` (build123d; specify-core-rust #56): a 100 × 80 × 10
plate with 4 × Ø6 holes on a Ø60 circle, a pocket, two chamfers and a boss underneath (each
`.old`), changed in ways that read badly before, each `.new`:

| Case | What changed |
| --- | --- |
| `complex_many` | holes 4 × Ø6 → 6 × Ø8, the pocket deeper and wider, a slot added, the chamfers and the boss removed |
| `complex_fillet_all` | R5 fillets on the four corners (the chamfers carry round them) |
| `complex_moved` | the geometry turned 90° and moved, and the holes Ø6 → Ø7 |
| `complex_remodelled` | the same shape, built as two halves |
| `complex_counterbore` | the through holes counterbored |
| `complex_pattern` | 4 holes on Ø60 → 5 on Ø48 |

`gramil_assembly` (under the Open Community License v1: see `LICENSE-gramil`) is two revisions of gramil's assembly (pzfreo/gramil 9171ef6),
12 distinct parts, made by `gramil_assembly.py` from a gramil checkout with its
venv (build123d 0.10.0) and gzipped (`gzip -9`), for `tests/assembly_diff.rs`. Both are the
production build (`process.prototype=False`, as gramil's `scripts/build_production.py`). The
new revision is gramil's defaults; the old has `shaft.drive_plate_mount_depth` 4 (not 5) and
`drive_plate.mount_hole_diameter` 2.2 (not 2.4). So GRM-02 shaft's mount tap goes deeper, GRM-04
drive plate's mount hole goes Ø2.2 → Ø2.4, and the other 10 parts are unchanged. The shaft's end
chamfer is left alone; `gramil_shaft` below isolates that change (#67).

`plate_turned` is a plate and a block, made by `plate_turned.py` with build123d 0.10.0: the new
plate is the old one turned end for end in its own frame and placed as before, for
`tests/assembly_diff.rs` (a part that moved in its own frame is `moved`, not `unchanged`).

`bearing_flange` is build123d's `examples/cast_bearing_unit.py` (Apache-2.0, by Gumyr), an
oval flanged bearing housing with drafted sides, exported with build123d 0.11.0. The new
revision changes two parameters: the flange `A1` 11 → 13 thick and the bolt holes
`Hole(5)` → `Hole(4.5)`, Ø10 → Ø9.

`gramil_shaft` (For #67) is Paul Fremantle's gramil shaft from
[pzfreo/gramil](https://github.com/pzfreo/gramil), commit
`9171ef652e81daf7102c5155531493d36c349b3c`, under the Open Community License v1
(see `LICENSE-gramil`, also covering the generator). `gramil_shaft.py` uses
`gramil.parts.shaft.build_shaft` and gramil's `build123d.export_step` export path.
Both use default `PurflingCutterParams` with `process.prototype=False`; the only
difference is `shaft.end_chamfer`: 0 (old) and 1.5 (new). Reproduce with:

```sh
uv venv --python 3.12 /tmp/gramil-venv
uv pip install --python /tmp/gramil-venv/bin/python /path/to/gramil 'ocp-gordon==0.2.0'
/tmp/gramil-venv/bin/python gramil_shaft.py .
```

Generated with Python 3.12.13, build123d 0.10.0 and cadquery-ocp 7.8.1.1.post1.
Pinning ocp-gordon avoids 0.3.1's incompatible `OCP.collections` import with that
OCP version. The recipe writes both STEPs then gzips them with mtime 0.

The same recipe also writes two negative controls against `gramil_shaft.old`:
`gramil_shaft.shorter` adds the chamfer AND changes `shaft.length` 37.6 → 35.6;
`gramil_shaft.flat_moved` adds the chamfer AND changes `shaft.flat_depth` 0.6 → 0.8.
Their genuine boss height / flat plane changes must remain visible.

`edge_treatment_controls.py` (build123d 0.10.0, run with an output directory) makes
`flat_translated` and `plate_removed`. Both add a 1.5 × 45° top chamfer. The first
moves a finite flat 3 mm along a Ø16 × 40 cylinder, within its unchanged support
plane; three fixed, unequal bores anchor correspondence. The second removes a
10 × 50 × 50 upright from a 100 × 50 × 10 bracket with a Ø16 × 12 boss. The
fixture script gives all positions and dimensions. These guard against treating
plane equality or the presence of a chamfer as sufficient reason to hide a change.

`pmi_split` is a plate with two unequal bores, made by `pmi_split.py`. The new
revision retains the seam of two fused half plates (`SkipClean`): 8 faces become
12 with identical geometry. `tests/revision_pmi.rs` adds foreign flatness controls
on a planar face and its split supports, changing 0.2 to 0.1.
