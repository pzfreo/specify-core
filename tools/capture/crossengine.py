"""The cross-engine check's Python side: what specify-core (OpenCascade) reads back of the files
the Rust port wrote (``tests/fixtures/cross_engine/<case>/rust.step.gz``, written by
``cargo run --release --example write_fixtures``).

For each such file the read-back is exactly the oracle's (``cases.readback``: per part,
``read_existing``, ``part_settings`` and ``resume.answers_for`` on ``load(step, part=k)``, not
``api.analyse``), saved as ``python_readback.json.gz`` beside it, in the oracle's
``readback.json`` shape. Beside it, ``python_meta.json.gz`` says what was read (the
decompressed file's sha256, so the Rust test can tell a stale capture) and with which
specify-core.

OpenCascade can die reading a file (SIGSEGV in ``STEPCAFControl_Reader``: docs/upstream-needs.md
U15), so every read runs in a child process of its own: first the part count, then each part's
read-back, then (where wanted) each part's resume evidence, so a crash in one never takes the
value of another with it.
A child killed by a signal is recorded in place of the value it would have given as
``{"error": "crash", "message": "<signal> in <the call it was in>"}``, and the capture carries
on. A child that exits otherwise without a result is a failure of this tool, not an oracle
result, and stops the capture.

Also captured: where OpenCascade crashed, ``python_readback_without_symbols.json.gz``, a probe
reading the same file without the datum symbols' relationship (``without_symbol_relationship``)
to show what it reads apart from the crash; per part, the resume evidence (what Python's
pattern finds stored and the faces it fingerprints, ``_resume_evidence``) in
``python_meta.json.gz``; and the same evidence for every file Python wrote for the oracle
(``tests/fixtures/oracle/**/written.step.gz``) in ``<case>/python_written_evidence.json.gz``.
